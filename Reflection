Today I learned about what is Github. 
Its a web platform where we can store our project codes.
It provides us a coding environment where we can create, update our codes, track changes, collaborate with other coders code etc.
Github is the most important thing for a developer.

Then i learned about Gitpod.io, 
in simple its actually a text editor where we can create,update our codes and upload directly into GitHub cloud. 
And this codes can be accessible from anywhere by doing correct process.

Next they taught us about API. 
ApI is acts as a middle man which takes out request to the middleman, where middle man checks if the request is correct or not.
if correct then it will allow to controller which collects the data from database with the help of "driver" and after getting the data,the controller sends back as a response.

If we come to off-topic, i enjoyed a alot in this seesions. yeh i accept that at a specific point i felt boared but no worries the mentors removed the borism(?) by providing exciting challenges and explaining new topic. 

Its not new for me, the html, css and js is not new as i have done lot of projects on them, but for the first time i felt like "i dont know anything" but i hope i will get to know about the provided codes once they start explaining.

Thank you from bottom of h-e-a-r-t :).
